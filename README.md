# Ferniquilt The Aperiodic Tiler

Live demo: https://ferniquilt.netlify.app/

A small client-side app that builds and visualizes cut-and-project (dual multigrid) tilings in 2D. All logic runs in the browser.

This is a HTML+JS port of a Python app by [Thomas Fernique](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~fernique/).

## Quick start
Open `index.html` in a browser.

## How it works (high level)
* Slopes (rows) are generated by `generateSlopeE`.
* Rows are orthonormalized and converted to generators (grid) via `generators_to_grid`.
* The dual multigrid is enumerated by dual using a shift vector; the UI exposes zero or random shift.
* For visualization the code builds an orthonormal projection via orthogonal_projection (visualization supports d = 2 only).
* Tiles are rendered to SVG by `draw_tiling` with color mapping from couleur.
* UI wiring and the main controller are implemented in generate`` and the element access helper `els`.
* SVG export is handled by the export routine (`onExport` in tiler.js).

## Usage (UI)
* Adjust sliders for:
   * d (dimension of slope) — visualization supports d = 2
   * n (number of vectors)
   * k (grid bound — search indices −k…k)
* Choose Shift vector S: Random or Zero
* Choose palette mode and colors
* Click "Generate Tiling" to render
* Click "Export SVG" to download the last rendered tiling

## Files
* index.html — app entry, UI and CDN includes
* tiler.js — core logic and rendering (key symbols: generateSlopeE, generators_to_grid, dual, orthogonal_projection, draw_tiling, couleur, generate, els, onExport in tiler.js)
* style.css — minor styles and button class
* readme.md — this file

## Notes & dependencies
* numeric.js is loaded from CDN in index.html for matrix inversion and dot products.
* Visualization is implemented for d = 2 only; other d values will show a helpful message.
* The demo is static and client-side — no build step required.
